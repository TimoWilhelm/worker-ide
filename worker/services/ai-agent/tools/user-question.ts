Usage:
- ONLY use this when the answer requires human judgment, preference, or information not available in the project (e.g. choosing between design alternatives, confirming destructive actions, or requesting credentials/config values).
- Do NOT ask the user questions that can be answered by reading code, grepping, globbing, fetching docs, or any other tool.
- Provide suggested options as a comma-separated string to help guide the user.
- The user can pick from the options or provide a custom answer.
- The answer will arrive in the user's next message, so plan accordingly.`;
