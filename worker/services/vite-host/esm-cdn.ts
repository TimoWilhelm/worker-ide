 * and would otherwise be left as a bare external that fails at load time
 * (`No such module "ssr/<pkg>"`). This module bridges that gap: unresolved,
 * registered dependencies are fetched from the esm.sh CDN at build time and
 * inlined, exactly like the static/SPA pipeline already does.
 *
 * React (and the rest of the RSC runtime) is kept external in the esm.sh URL so
 * a fetched module's `import "react"` re-enters the bridge and resolves to the
 * SAME vendored React the rest of the build uses — a second React instance
 * would break hooks.
