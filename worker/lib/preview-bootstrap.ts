/**
 * Preview bootstrap: the single cross-Durable-Object round trip that primes a
 * preview request.
 *
 * Serving a preview needs a handful of project facts up front — does the project
 * exist, its `wrangler.jsonc` asset settings, and a cheap tree probe to select
 * the runtime. Each of those reads is a cross-DO RPC to the filesystem DO
 * (~hundreds of ms of pure latency, cross-region), so issuing them separately
 * (or even concurrently) pays that latency per call. {@link ProjectFilesystem.collectPreviewBootstrap}
 * does every read LOCALLY inside the DO (SQLite reads are ~0ms there) and returns
 * the whole snapshot in one message, collapsing ~7 round trips into one.
 *
 * This module holds the request/response contract plus the pure assembler that
 * turns the raw snapshot into a {@link ProjectProbe}. Detection knowledge (which
 * files/directories matter) lives here, next to the runtime registry it feeds —
 * the DO stays a generic reader that is told what to read.
