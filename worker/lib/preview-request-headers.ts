/**
 * Shared request-header sanitization for preview requests.
 *
 * Preview requests are served on the shared preview domain and their bodies are
 * ultimately handled by untrusted, generated application code (the React-SPA
 * worker isolate or the vinext server isolate). Any credential the browser
 * attaches to a preview request — most importantly the signed
 * `worker-ide-preview-access` grant cookie that authorizes access to a private
 * preview — must be removed before the request reaches that code, otherwise a
 * malicious app could read the token and exfiltrate it to bypass private-preview
 * access control.
 *
 * Private-preview access is validated up front in the top-level fetch handler,
 * so these headers are never needed once a request is dispatched to a runtime.
